Files in this directory are automatically generated from your Rails Engines.
They are copied from the 'public' directories of each engine into this directory
each time Rails starts (server, console... any time 'start_engine' is called).
Any edits you make will NOT persist across the next server restart; instead you
should edit the files within the <plugin_name>/assets/ directory itself.
