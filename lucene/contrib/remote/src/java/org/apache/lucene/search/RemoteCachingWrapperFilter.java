/**
 * Provides caching of {@link org.apache.lucene.search.Filter}s themselves on the remote end of an RMI connection.

 * <p/>
 * NOTE: This does NOT cache the Filter bits, but rather the Filter itself.
 * Thus, this works hand-in-hand with {@link org.apache.lucene.search.CachingWrapperFilter} to keep both
 * file Filter cache and the Filter bits on the remote end, close to the searcher.
 * <p/>
 * Usage:
 * <p/>
 * To cache a result you must do something like 
 * RemoteCachingWrapperFilter f = new RemoteCachingWrapperFilter(new CachingWrapperFilter(myFilter));
