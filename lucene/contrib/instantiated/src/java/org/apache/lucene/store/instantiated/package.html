<p>InstantiatedIndex, alternative RAM store for small corpora.</p>

<p>@lucene.experimental</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
  Represented as a coupled graph of class instances, this
  all-in-memory index store implementation delivers search
  results up to a 100 times faster than the file-centric RAMDirectory
  at the cost of greater RAM consumption.
</p>

<h2>API</h2>

<p>
  Just as the default store implementation, InstantiatedIndex
  comes with an IndexReader and IndexWriter. The latter share
  many method signatures with the file-centric IndexWriter.
</p>

<p>
  It is also possible to load the content of another index
  by passing an IndexReader to the InstantiatedIndex constructor.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>
  At a few thousand ~160 characters long documents
  InstantiatedIndex outperforms RAMDirectory some 50x,
  15x at 100 documents of 2000 characters length,
  and is linear to RAMDirectory at 10,000 documents of 2000 characters length.
</p>

<p>Mileage may vary depending on term saturation.</p>

<p>
  Populated with a single document InstantiatedIndex is almost, but not quite, as fast as MemoryIndex.    
</p>

<p>
  It takes more or less the same time to populate an InstantiatedIndex
  as it takes to populate a RAMDirectory. Hardly any effort has been put
  in to optimizing the InstantiatedIndexWriter, only minimizing the amount
  of time needed to write-lock the index has been considered.
</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No locks! Consider using InstantiatedIndex as if it was immutable.</li>
  <li>No documents with fields containing readers.</li>
  <li>No field selection when retrieving documents, as all stored field are available in memory.</li>
  <li>Any document returned must cloned if they are to be touched.</li>
  <li>Norms array returned must not be touched.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use cases</h2>

<p>
  Could replace any small index that could do with greater response time.
  spell check a priori index,
  the index of new documents exposed to user search agent queries,
  to compile classifiers in machine learning environments, etc.
