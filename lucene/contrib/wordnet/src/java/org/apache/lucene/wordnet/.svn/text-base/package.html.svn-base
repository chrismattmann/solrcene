<title>WordNet Lucene Synonyms Integration</title>
</head>
<body>

    This package uses synonyms defined by <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</a>.
    There are two methods: query expansion and analysis.
    
    Both methods first require you to download the <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/2.0/WNprolog-2.0.tar.gz">WordNet prolog database</a>
    Inside this archive is a file named wn_s.pl, which contains the WordNet synonyms. 
    
    <h1>Query Expansion Method</h1>
    This method creates Lucene index storing the synonyms, which in turn can be used for query expansion.

    You normally run {@link org.apache.lucene.wordnet.Syns2Index} once to build the query index/"database", and then call
    {@link org.apache.lucene.wordnet.SynExpand#expand SynExpand.expand(...)} to expand a query.

    <p>

	<h3> Instructions </h3>
	<ol>
	<li> Invoke Syn2Index as appropriate to build a synonym index.
	    It'll take 2 arguments, the path to wn_s.pl from the WordNet download, and the index name.
   
	 <li> Update your UI so that as appropriate you call SynExpand.expand(...) to expand user queries with synonyms.
       </ol>
    
    <h1>Analysis Method</h1>
    This method injects additional synonym tokens for tokens from a child {@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenStream}.
    
    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    <ol>
    	<li>Create a {@link org.apache.lucene.wordnet.SynonymMap}, passing in the path to wn_s.pl
    	<li>Add a {@link org.apache.lucene.wordnet.SynonymTokenFilter} to your analyzer. Note: SynonymTokenFilter should be after LowerCaseFilter, 
    	because it expects terms to already be in lowercase.
    </ol>
