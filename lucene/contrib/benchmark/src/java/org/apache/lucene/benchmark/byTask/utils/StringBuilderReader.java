/**
 * Implements a {@link Reader} over a {@link StringBuilder} instance. Although
 * one can use {@link java.io.StringReader} by passing it
 * {@link StringBuilder#toString()}, it is better to use this class, as it
 * doesn't mark the passed-in {@link StringBuilder} as shared (which will cause
 * inner char[] allocations at the next append() attempt).<br>
 * Notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>This implementation assumes the underlying {@link StringBuilder} is not
 * changed during the use of this {@link Reader} implementation.
 * <li>This implementation is thread-safe.
 * <li>The implementation looks very much like {@link java.io.StringReader} (for
 * the right reasons).
 * <li>If one wants to reuse that instance, then the following needs to be done:
 * <pre>
 * StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("some text");
 * Reader reader = new StringBuilderReader(sb);
 * ... read from reader - don't close it ! ...
 * sb.setLength(0);
 * sb.append("some new text");
 * reader.reset();
 * ... read the new string from the reader ...
 * </pre>
 * </ul>
