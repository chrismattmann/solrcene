/**
 * A DocMaker reading one line at a time as a Document from a single file. This
 * saves IO cost (over DirContentSource) of recursing through a directory and
 * opening a new file for every document. It also re-uses its Document and Field
 * instance to improve indexing speed.<br>
 * The expected format of each line is (arguments are separated by &lt;TAB&gt;):
 * <i>title, date, body</i>. If a line is read in a different format, a
 * {@link RuntimeException} will be thrown. In general, you should use this doc
 * maker with files that were created with 
 * {@link org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.tasks.WriteLineDocTask}.<br>
 * <br>
 * Config properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>doc.random.id.limit=N (default -1) -- create random docid in the range
 * 0..N; this is useful with UpdateDoc to test updating random documents; if
 * this is unspecified or -1, then docid is sequentially assigned
 * </ul>
 * @deprecated Please use {@link DocMaker} instead, with content.source=LineDocSource
