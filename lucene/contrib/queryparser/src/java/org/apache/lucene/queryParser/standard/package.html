Contains the implementation of the Lucene query parser using the flexible query parser frameworks

<h2>Lucene Flexible Query Parser Implementation</h2>
<p>
The old Lucene query parser used to have only one class that performed 
all the parsing operations. In the new query parser structure, the 
parsing was divided in 3 steps: parsing (syntax), processing (semantic)
and building.
</p>
<p>
The classes contained in the package org.apache.lucene.queryParser.standard
are used to reproduce the same behavior as the old query parser.
</p>

<p>
Check <tt>org.apache.lucene.queryParser.standard.StandardQueryParser</tt> to quick start using the Lucene query parser. 
</p>

<p>
There are 2 wrapper classes that extends QueryParser and MultiFieldQueryParser.
The classes implement internally the new query parser structure. These 2 
classes are deprecated and should only be used when there is a need to use the
old query parser interface.
