      Geographical filtering & sorting with Lucene
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>

<p>This package makes it possible to filter and sort according to
geographical constraints.  For example, filter to include only
restaurants within 2 miles of a specified latitude/longitude, sorting
by distance ascending.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.nsshutdown.com/projects/lucene/whitepaper/locallucene_v2.html">here</a>
for details on the technical approach.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this package is still very new, and has little to no
documentation.  It's best to ask for pointers on
java-user@lucene.apache.org, and look at the unit tests included in
the source distribution.</p>

<p>There are also known issues, eg at
least <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1815">LUCENE-1781</a>
and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1815">LUCENE-1815</a>.</p>

<p><font color="red"><b>NOTE:</b> This package is still in flux and
might change in incompatible ways in the next release.</font>
