This module contains a number of filter and query objects that add to core lucene.

==== The "MoreLikeThis" class from the "similarity" module has been copied into here.
If people are generally happy with this move then the similarity module can be deleted, or at least a 
"Moved to queries module..." note left in its place.

==== FuzzyLikeThis - mixes the behaviour of FuzzyQuery and MoreLikeThis but with special consideration
of fuzzy scoring factors. This generally produces good results for queries where users may provide details in a number of 
fields and have no knowledge of boolean query syntax and also want a degree of fuzzy matching. The query is fast because, like
MoreLikeThis, it optimizes the query to only the most distinguishing terms.

==== BoostingQuery - effectively demotes search results that match a given query. 
Unlike the "NOT" clause, this still selects documents that contain undesirable terms, 
but reduces the overall score of docs containing these terms.

==== TermsFilter -  Unlike a RangeFilter this can be used for filtering on multiple terms that are not necessarily in 
a sequence. An example might be a collection of primary keys from a database query result or perhaps 
a choice of "category" labels picked by the end user.

==== RegexQuery - Implements the regular expression term search query.
