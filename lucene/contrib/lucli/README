lucli (pronounced Luckily) is the Lucene Command Line Interface.

INSTALLATION

Call "ant", then call the run.sh shell script. If it doesn't work right away:
	Edit JAVA_HOME to point to your java directory.
	Edit LUCLI to point to where you installed lucli.
	Edit LUCLI_MEMORY and set it to the maximum amount of memory you want to allocate to lucli
	You can also replace the Lucene jar file that came with lucli with your own.

Enjoy
