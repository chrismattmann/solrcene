<section id="About this Document"><title>About this Document</title>
<p>
This document is intended as a "getting started" guide to installing and running the Lucene
web application demo.  This guide assumes that you have read the information in the previous two
examples.  We'll use Tomcat as our reference web container.  These demos should work with nearly any
container, but you may have to adapt them appropriately.
</p>

<section id="About the Demos"><title>About the Demos</title>
<p>
The Lucene Web Application demo is a template web application intended for deployment on Tomcat or a
similar web container.  It's NOT designed as a "best practices" implementation by ANY means.  It's
more of a "hello world" type Lucene Web App.  The purpose of this application is to demonstrate
Lucene.  With that being said, it should be relatively simple to create a small searchable website
in Tomcat or a similar application server.

<section id="Indexing Files"><title>Indexing Files</title>
<p> Once you've gotten this far you're probably itching to go.  Let's start by creating the index
you'll need for the web examples.  Since you've already set your CLASSPATH in the previous examples,
all you need to do is type:

<pre>
    java org.apache.lucene.demo.IndexHTML -create -index {index-dir} ..
</pre>

You'll need to do this from a (any) subdirectory of your <code>{tomcat}/webapps</code> directory
(make sure you didn't leave off the <code>..</code> or you'll get a null pointer exception).
<code>{index-dir}</code> should be a directory that Tomcat has permission to read and write, but is
outside of a web accessible context.  By default the webapp is configured to look in
<code>/opt/lucene/index</code> for this index.
</p>
</section>

<section id="Deploying the Demos"><title>Deploying the Demos</title>
<p>Located in your distribution directory you should see a war file called
<code>luceneweb.war</code>.  If you're working with a Subversion checkout, this will be under the
<code>build</code> subdirectory.  Copy this to your <code>{tomcat-home}/webapps</code> directory.
You may need to restart Tomcat.  </p> </section>

<section id="Configuration"><title>Configuration</title>
<p> From your Tomcat directory look in the <code>webapps/luceneweb</code> subdirectory.  If it's not
present, try browsing to <code>http://localhost:8080/luceneweb</code> (which causes Tomcat to deploy
the webapp), then look again.  Edit a file called <code>configuration.jsp</code>.  Ensure that the
<code>indexLocation</code> is equal to the location you used for your index.  You may also customize
the <code>appTitle</code> and <code>appFooter</code> strings as you see fit.  Once you have finished
altering the configuration you may need to restart Tomcat.  You may also wish to update the war file
by typing <code>jar -uf luceneweb.war configuration.jsp</code> from the <code>luceneweb</code>
subdirectory.  (The -u option is not available in all versions of jar.  In this case recreate the
war file).

<section id="Running the Demos"><title>Running the Demos</title>
<p>Now you're ready to roll.  In your browser set the url to
<code>http://localhost:8080/luceneweb</code> enter <code>test</code> and the number of items per
page and press search.</p>
<p>You should now be looking either at a number of results (provided you didn't erase the Tomcat
examples) or nothing.  If you get an error regarding opening the index, then you probably set the
path in <code>configuration.jsp</code> incorrectly or Tomcat doesn't have permissions to the index
(or you skipped the step of creating it).  Try other search terms.  Depending on the number of items
per page you set and results returned, there may be a link at the bottom that says <b>More
Results>></b>; clicking it takes you to subsequent pages.  </p> </section>
