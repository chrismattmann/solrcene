/**
 * <p>
 *   Converts each token into its {@link java.text.CollationKey}, and then
 *   encodes the CollationKey with {@link IndexableBinaryStringTools}, to allow 
 *   it to be stored as an index term.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   <strong>WARNING:</strong> Make sure you use exactly the same Collator at
 *   index and query time -- CollationKeys are only comparable when produced by
 *   the same Collator.  Since {@link java.text.RuleBasedCollator}s are not
 *   independently versioned, it is unsafe to search against stored
 *   CollationKeys unless the following are exactly the same (best practice is
 *   to store this information with the index and check that they remain the
 *   same at query time):
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>JVM vendor</li>
 *   <li>JVM version, including patch version</li>
 *   <li>
 *     The language (and country and variant, if specified) of the Locale
 *     used when constructing the collator via
 *     {@link Collator#getInstance(java.util.Locale)}.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The collation strength used - see {@link Collator#setStrength(int)}
 *   </li>
 * </ol> 
 * <p>
 *   The <code>ICUCollationKeyFilter</code> in the icu package of Lucene's
 *   contrib area uses ICU4J's Collator, which makes its
 *   version available, thus allowing collation to be versioned independently
 *   from the JVM.  ICUCollationKeyFilter is also significantly faster and
 *   generates significantly shorter keys than CollationKeyFilter.  See
 *   <a href="http://site.icu-project.org/charts/collation-icu4j-sun"
 *   >http://site.icu-project.org/charts/collation-icu4j-sun</a> for key
 *   generation timing and key length comparisons between ICU4J and
 *   java.text.Collator over several languages.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   CollationKeys generated by java.text.Collators are not compatible
 *   with those those generated by ICU Collators.  Specifically, if you use 
 *   CollationKeyFilter to generate index terms, do not use
 *   ICUCollationKeyFilter on the query side, or vice versa.
